## Wiring

The robot in the [video](#3d-printing) has the next alternartive components:

- [ ] TTGO T7 ESP32 Board (is possible Wemos ESP8266, see below)
- [ ] D1 Mini proto PCB (for wire connections and connectors)
- [ ] D1 Mini OLED shield (optional)
- [ ] Two small servos (SG90 or compatible modified to 360Â¤)
- [ ] LIPO battery of 3.7v
- [ ] Two M3/M2 screws (also with servo screw maybe works)
- [ ] Two Rubber O-Rings Seal 35mm OD 31mm ID 2mm Width

The pins used to connect the servos are: 16,17.

## Firmware

You can build and upload one of these firmware using PlatformIO, with a simple command you can upload both, the Joysticks or the Robot firmware. Connect first the robot board and then the joystick to the USB of your computer and run some one of this alternatives:

```bash
pio run -e mini-tank --target upload
pio run -e xiao-tank --target upload
pio run -e mg995-red-tank --target upload
pio run -e mg995-black-tank --target upload
pio run -e m5joystick --target upload
```
