- [ ] D1 Mini proto PCB (for wire connections and connectors)
- [ ] D1 Mini OLED shield (optional)

## Firmware

You can build and upload one of these firmware using PlatformIO, with a simple command you can upload both, the Joysticks or the Robot firmware. Connect first the robot board and then the joystick to the USB of your computer and run some one of this alternatives:

```bash
pio run -e mini-tank --target upload
pio run -e xiao-tank --target upload
pio run -e mg995-red-tank --target upload
pio run -e mg995-black-tank --target upload
pio run -e m5joystick --target upload
```
